2024 12 10
- use for game
- make presentation
- bug: choice is not stored across scene reload

2024 12 11
- transition from global data to data-from-resource
- working sample

2024 12 12 
- made it so changing the array can cause update to visuals
- BUG(2024 12 12): res://addons/scene-select-plugin/scene_select_property.gd:57 - Invalid access to property or key of type 'StringName' on a base object of type 'Resource (SceneSelect)'.
-> bug happened when i tried addinv my EditorProperty script with add_property_editor_for_multiple_properties(), 
but still was calling get_edited_property(), which according to the docs, only works for single-property-editors
- bug(2024 12 12): scene select ui not showing node preview
-> code was still using old symbol names


TODO
- 
- make the instantiated sprite clickable to get the object in editor
- make usage simpler, so it's SceneSelect resource + SceneList resource
- clean up ui: label should adhere to same format specs as other inspector fields (it's too long)
-> BUG: tried different ways of trimming the field, from text overrun behavior to changing node type to line edit field
		in all cases, it causes the editor to hang when i widen the inspector tab enough for the full name to show 
		(as soon as the last character would be drawn)
- clean up the ui (hide, read-only, ...)



ICED:
2024 12 10
- bug: deleting/changing the currently selected item from global list does not cause update in property
-> iced because transition from global data to data-from-resource 
- bug: „commont parent not found“ -> couldn’t solve it.
-> iced because error hasn't occured since design transitioned from global data to data-from-resource
