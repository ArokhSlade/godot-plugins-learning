how do i identify a property as being of the "entity_selection_array" category?
or even "array to select anything from" category?
maybe make the property a custom type?

{ "name": "unique_name_in_owner"
 "class_name": &""
 "type": 1
 "hint": 0
 "hint_string": ""
 "usage": 2


wip bugs and features
DONE
- bug: drop-down menu resetting on its own -> fixed
- feature: two display modes: drop-down menu and reosurce picker
- feature: both displays update each other
- feature: resource picker only allows values from drop-down
 - bug: drop-down not updating when enemy picked with drag-and-drop -> fixed
- feature: auto-generate drop-down item name list
 - implementation: parse names from file paths
- feature: name array is read-only in editor
- feature: generate preview picture
- implementation: handle null instances (preview generation etc.)
- feature: add and remove items from global array -> names update automatically
- bug: at start-up, when null-element is selected, still an old preview is shown
2024 12 10:
- use for game
- make presentation
- bug: choice is not stored across scene reload

2024 12 11 
- LEAK/style: enemy_picker_plugin: current_value = EnemyChoice.new() # TODO: dont't reallocate

2024 12 12
- made it so changing the array can cause updated visuals

be able to click the instantiated sprite in the editor
-> by using the group nodes feature


TODO
-update old work logs
-idea 3:
SceneSelect extends Node
SceneSelectInspector will still trigger via _parse_property()
design conflict: 
make it a Node, to keep it general purpose, as is the intent
or make it Node2D to allow it to render in the editor?
-> strategy: go with node2D first to get to results with less complications
			then try to make it work with Node
- make it so from parent node with the property we can directly jump to the SceneSelect child-node to edit its list (with the movie-scene icon)
- handle uninitialized properties
- redraw the thing to nothing if it's empty
- restrict available choices to only direct children of the node that has the SceneSelect variable
-streamline the process of having a SceneSelect resource AND a SceneList resource



ICED: 
- bug: deleting/changing the currently selected item from global list does not cause update in property
-> iced because not using global list anymore
- bug: „commont parent not found“ -> couldn’t solve it.
-> iced because bug not occuring anymore
